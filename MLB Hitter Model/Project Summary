Summary:
- Each task that members on MLB front offices undertake involve some form of player evaluation. The goal of this project was to build a basic
evaluation model that takes player results and determines a "ballpark" salary value according to those features. The model could help executives
determine an arbitrary salary figure, but more importantly, asses how the player performs relative to the salary they earned in a given season. It also
helps compare a player and their salary to the rest of the players in the league and their salaries, affording more of a qualitative "value" benchmark
as opposed to a raw salary figure that the player is worth. In reality, player salaries account for more than the results a player had in years prior; 
team value, inflation, marketability, importance to team culture/locker room and more features are accounted for when GM's offer player contracts. 
My team and I looked to account for some of these non-results oriented features in our model but were unable to acquire the full scope of data neccesary
for each player given our time-frame for completion. We evaluated the effectiveness of the model as the difference between predicted salary and actual salary.
The model worked quite well with players in their pre arbitration through arbitration years but struggled at the upper end of AAV as it underpredicted
these figures. Still, the deployment on 2021 results data afforded insights including the undervalue of players, such as Wilmer Flores, who was afforded 
an extension prior to the 2022 season. In the future, this model could be improved by accouting for play by play data and ball flight metrics to incorporate
features that help determine projectability outside of a mere "years since debut" feature. 

There were several motivations leading to the undertaking of this project. 

- I looked to gain a deeper understanding of the different modeling choices I could make given my target outcome.
    * It was important for me to have an understanding of the different steps of the modeling process and how to evaluate the effectiveness 
      of different choices.
- My teammates participating in this project with had little domain knowledge
    * Designing a project that helped teach my peers about a popular US sport through the application of data science expertise helped
      understand an unfamiliar sport through a familar lens.
- Establish modeling experience through the twists and turns of undertaking a broad topic
    * There were many different routes that we could have gone down to develop an effective model with such a broad topic goal. While this
      did not make the project easier, I was able to think about the factors that should be considered in the undertaking of future projects.
    
    
I learned several lessons through working with my team in the development of this project.

- More specific project goals are easier to handle because there is less ambiguity in determining which features to include and their evlauating
their ability to predict the target variable.
- Individuals from a range of backgrounds offer perspectives that help shape modeling choices and performance analysis
- Baseball salaries are based on significnatly more information that past performance
- Model evaluation is not always going to be a clear accurary metric, but sometimes requires understanding of model outputs to determine its utility.
