Summary:
- Each MLB front office task involves some form of player evaluation. This project aimed to build a basic evaluation model that takes player 
results and determines a "ballpark" salary value according to those features. The model could help executives determine an arbitrary salary 
figure, but more importantly, asses how the player performs relative to the salary they earned in a given season. It also helps compare a 
player and their salary to the other players in the league and their salaries, affording more of a qualitative "value" benchmark than a "raw" 
salary figure that the player is worth. In reality, player salaries account for more than a player's results in years prior; team value, 
inflation, marketability, importance to team culture/locker room, and more features are accounted for when GMs offer player contracts. My team 
and I looked to account for some of these non-results-oriented features in our model. Still, we required additional data to acquire the full 
scope of data necessary to improve predictions for each player, given our time frame for completion. We evaluated the model's effectiveness 
as the difference between predicted and actual salaries. The model worked quite well with players in their pre-arbitration through arbitration 
years but struggled at the upper end of AAV as it underpredicted these figures. Still, deploying the model on 2021 results data afforded insights, 
including undervalued players like Wilmer Flores, who received an extension after the 2021 season. This model could be improved in the future 
by accounting for play-by-play data and ball flight metrics to incorporate features that help determine projectability outside of a mere "years 
since debut" feature. 

There were several motivations leading to the undertaking of this project. 

- I looked to gain a deeper understanding of the different modeling choices I could make given my target outcome.
    * It was important for me to have an understanding of the different steps of the modeling process and how to evaluate the effectiveness 
      of different choices.
- My teammates participating in this project with had little domain knowledge
    * Designing a project that helped teach my peers about a popular US sport through the application of data science expertise helped
      understand an unfamiliar sport through a familar lens.
- Establish modeling experience through the twists and turns of undertaking a broad topic
    * There were many different routes that we could have gone down to develop an effective model with such a broad topic goal. While this
      did not make the project easier, I was able to think about the factors that should be considered in the undertaking of future projects.
    
    
I learned several lessons through working with my team in the development of this project.

- More specific project goals are easier to handle because there is less ambiguity in determining which features to include and their evlauating
their ability to predict the target variable.
- Individuals from a range of backgrounds offer perspectives that help shape modeling choices and performance analysis
- Baseball salaries are based on significnatly more information that past performance
- Model evaluation is not always going to be a clear accurary metric, but sometimes requires understanding of model outputs to determine its utility.
